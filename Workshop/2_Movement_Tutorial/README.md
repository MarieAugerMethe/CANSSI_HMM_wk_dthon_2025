# CANSSI UBC Hidden Markov Model: *Movement Tutorial*

We will learn to apply HMMs to movement data using the R package momentuHMM. During most of the tutorial, we will look at a narwhal dataset provided by Dr. Marianne Marcoux. The narwhals have been tagged in Tremblay Sound, Nunavut, Canada. We will look at their movement over a two-week duration.
