# CANSSI OTN Hidden Markov Model: *Afternoon Tutorial*

We will learn how to fit a basic HMM to the acceleration data of a free-ranging blacktip reef shark (Papastamatiou et al. 2015) using the R package hmmTMB. There will be exercises at the end of the tutorial to give you a chance to practice fitting HMMs on your own. Solutions will be posted in this repository the following day.
