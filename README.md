# Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute (CANSSI) Hidden Markov Model Workshop and Datathon 2025
# Hosted by the Department of Statistics at the University of British Columbia

## Description and format

This workshop and datathon were developed by the CANSSI collaborative research team led by Vianey Leos Barajas, and Marie Auger-Méthé, in particular thanks to the effort of Fanny Dupont, Arturo Esquivel, Marco Gallegos Herrada, Sofia Ruiz Suarez, Eric Ste-Marie, and Vinky Wang. The tutorial materials are based on previous tutorials given by members of the teams as well as past contributors: Natasha Klappstein and Ron Togunov. 

The goal of the workshop is to illustrate how hidden Markov models (HMMs) can be used to classify hidden states from time series data using a range of movement and biologging data. It is divided into two parts: Acceleration tutorial and Movement tutorial.

**Important: the data shared for the datathon is meant to be used only in the context of this datathon and not for publication. Please refer to each of the datathon files for information on the data use.**
